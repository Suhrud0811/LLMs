      "Summary: David Adedeji Adeleke OON (born November 21, 1992), known professionally as Davido, is a Nigerian singer, songwriter and record producer. He is regarded as one of the most important Afrobeats artists of the 21st century, and for popularizing the genre globally.\n",
      "Davido  was born in Atlanta, United States, and raised in Lagos, Nigeria. He made his music debut as a member of the group KB International. Davido studied business administration at Oakwood University before dropping out to make beats and record vocal references. He rose to fame after releasing \"Dami Duro\", the second single from his debut studio album Omo Baba Olowo (2012), from which six additional singles—\"Back When\", \"Ekuro\", \"Overseas\", \"All of You\", \"Gbon Gbon\" and \"Feel Alright\"—were taken. In 2012, Davido won the Next Rated award at The Headies. Between 2013 and 2015, he released the hit singles \"Gobe\", \"One of a Kind\", \"Skelewu\", \"Aye\", \"Tchelete (Goodlife)\", \"Naughty\", \"Owo Ni Koko\", \"The Sound\" and \"The Money\".\n",
      "In January 2016, Davido announced on Twitter he had signed a record deal with Sony Music and a few months later, he founded the record label Davido Music Worldwide, to which acts including Dremo and Peruzzi are currently signed. In July 2016, Davido signed a record deal with Sony's RCA Records and in October the same year, he released the five-track Extended Play (EP) Son of Mercy, which was supported by the singles \"Gbagbe Oshi\", \"How Long\" and \"Coolest Kid in Africa\". In April 2017, Davido re-negotiated his contract with Sony due to creative control issues and later that year, he released five singles including \"If\" and \"Fall\". \"If\" generated worldwide social-media activity while \"Fall\" became the longest-charting Nigerian pop song in Billboard history. Davido released his second studio album A Good Time in November 2019; it was supported by the previously released singles \"If\", \"Fall\", \"Assurance\", \"Blow My Mind\" and \"Risky\".\n",
      "In 2019,  New African magazine listed Davido as one of the 100 most-influential Africans. His third studio album A Better Time was released on November 13, 2020, and in February 2021, he appeared on Time magazine's Time 100 Next List. Davido released Timeless, his fourth studio album, on March 31, 2023. He is a cultural ambassador for Nigeria and a prominent voice of human rights in Africa. He is also one of the most-followed African artists on Instagram and Twitter.\n",
      "In November 2023, Davido received three nominations at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards for \"Unavailable\", \"Feel\" and his album Timeless. In January 2024, Davido received three nominations at the 55th NAACP Image Awards.\n",

      "Summary: Susan Magdalane Boyle (born 1 April 1961) is a Scottish singer. She rose to fame in 2009 after appearing as a contestant on the third series of Britain's Got Talent, singing \"I Dreamed a Dream\" from Les Misérables. As of 2021, Boyle has sold 25 million records. Her debut album, I Dreamed a Dream (2009), is one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century, having sold over 10 million copies worldwide, and it was the best-selling album internationally in 2009. In 2011, Boyle made UK music history by becoming the first female artist to achieve three successive albums debut at No.1 in less than two years.\n",
      "Boyle's debut studio album, I Dreamed a Dream, was released in November 2009; it became the UK's best-selling debut album of all time, beating the previous record held by Spirit by Leona Lewis, and set a record for first-week sales by a debut album, according to the Official Charts Company. In her first year of fame, Boyle made £5 million (£8.5 million today) with the release of I Dreamed a Dream and its lead-off singles, \"I Dreamed a Dream\" and \"Wild Horses\". The success continued with her second studio album, The Gift (2010), where she became only the third act ever (and the first woman artist) to top both the UK and US album charts with two different albums in the same year. It was followed by Boy\u001b[0m\n",
